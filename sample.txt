Fraud Detection is a vital topic that applies to many industries including the financial sectors, banking, government agencies, insurance, and law enforcement, and more. Fraud endeavors have detected a radical rise in current years, creating this topic more critical than ever. Despite struggles on the part of the troubled organizations, hundreds of millions of dollars are wasted to fraud each year. Because nearly a few samples confirm fraud in a vast community, locating these can be complex. Data mining and statistics help to predict and immediately distinguish fraud and take immediate action to minimize costs.

Continuous-variable quantum neural networks
 XanaduAI/quantum-neural-networks •  • 18 Jun 2018

The quantum neural network is a variational quantum circuit built in the continuous-variable (CV) architecture, which encodes quantum information in continuous degrees of freedom such as the amplitudes of the electromagnetic field.
